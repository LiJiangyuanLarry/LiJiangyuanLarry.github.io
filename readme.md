# Ties de Kok - Personal Website (+ Generator)

This is my custom spin a personal website generator based on the following needs:

- Be as simple as possible. It only uses HTML, CSS, Python, JSON, and Jinja2. 
- Generate all pages and the CV based on a single JSON file.
- Be able to generate a PDF version of the CV.

In order to change the content, I only change the following files:

- `db.json`: All the content of the pages and the CV.
- `index.html`: The content of the home page. 

The rest of the files are generated automatically.
