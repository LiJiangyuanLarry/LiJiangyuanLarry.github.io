                <p style="text-align: justify;">Disagreement measures are known to predict cross-sectional stock returns but fail to predict market returns. This paper proposes a partial least squares disagreement index by aggregating information across individual disagreement measures and shows that this index significantly predicts market returns both in- and out-of-sample. Consistent with the theory in Atmaz and Basak (2018), the disagreement index asymmetrically predicts market returns with greater power in high-sentiment periods, is positively associated with investor expectations of market returns, predicts market returns through a cash flow channel, and can explain the positive volume-volatility relationship.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Time series momentum (TSM) refers to the predictability of the past 12-month return on the next one-month return and is the focus of several recent influential studies. This paper shows that asset-by-asset time series regressions reveal little evidence of TSM, both in- and out-of-sample. While the t-statistic in a pooled regression appears large, it is not statistically reliable as it is less than the critical values of parametric and nonparametric bootstraps. From an investment perspective, the TSM strategy is profitable, but its performance is virtually the same as that of a similar strategy that is based on historical sample mean and does not require predictability. Overall, the evidence on TSM is weak, particularly for the large cross section of assets.</p>

            <b>Duration-dirven Carbon Premium</b><br>

            <summary>Abstract</summary>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">We observe two seemingly contradicting facts on carbon premium in recent years: a negative brown-minus-green (BMG) return spread and a positive association between realized stock return and carbon emission. We reconcile these facts through the lens of equity duration. The variation of equity duration premium explains the observed declining carbon premium in the short periods since 2004. In particular, short (long) equity duration is associated with brown (green) firms with high regulatory (opportunity) climate change exposure. However, theories (Gormsen, 2021) predict the duration premium to be time-varying. The expected carbon premium may be positive, while we observe a negative realized carbon premium.</p>
